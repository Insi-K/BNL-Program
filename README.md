# **About the Navigation Console Program**
This program was made in java using Eclipse IDE as part of my group assignment for my first year of university.

This project was originally intended to work with a Finch robot (provided by the university).

### **Nav. Console Version 1.2 Notes:**
---
* The program has been modified with a few corrections on the code grammar.
* The instructions for the finch robot no longer work.

In order to demonstrate the functionality of the program, any lines of code related to the functionality of the Finch robot have been disabled, however it still remains within the source code with added comments for reference.

All the code related to the UI of the program was written with the Swing library using references.

### **Instructions on how to use the program**
---
The source code has been exported as an executable jar file, currently it runs on "java 1.8".

**NOTE:** *Please make sure you have java installed*

- Once you run the program, a console like window will appear (similar to Windows' Command Prompt).
- Use the text box located at the bottom of the program to enter any input.
- Please note that the program just accepts certain inputs. Type "H" to list all available commands and its respective syntax.
- You can close the program by typing "Q".
- When you run the program a "ReadFile.txt" file will appear. This is part of the program's functionality:
    - You can type commands in the file. Make sure you write one command per line.
    - Once you have all your commands saved you can tell the program to run them all.
    - **IMPORTANT:** in order for this to work, write at least three commands inside the text file.
- The program is CASE sensitive. Make sure you type the command characters in capital letters.
- When you run the "Write" command (look for syntax by typing "H" on the console) a "LogFile.txt" file will appear. You can look a history of all the commands performed within a session.

A java file is included if you wish to take a look at the source code. You are welcomed to do so.
