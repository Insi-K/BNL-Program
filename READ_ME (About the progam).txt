---About the Navigation Console program---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was made in java using Eclipse IDE as part of my group assignment for my first year of University.

Ver 1.2:
<<The current version of the program has been modified with a few corrections on the code grammar>>.
<<The instruccions for the finch no longer work>>

It was intended to be used with a Finch robot provided by the university, however for demonstration purposes
the parts related to the control of the robot have been disabled. They still remain in the source code but
comments have been added for reference.

The core functionality for this console app has been desigined and implemented solely by me. 
This program was used with other different implementations to be compiled as a single app.

All the code related to the appearance of the program (Swing) has been written upon reference.

---Instruccions on how to use the program-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code has been exported as an executable jar file, currently it runs on "java 1.8".
Please make sure you have java installed.

	- Once you run the program a console like window will appear (similar to commmand prompt from Windows).

	- Use the text box located at the bottom of the program to enter any input
	
	- Please note that the program just accepts certain inputs. Type "H" to list all available commands and
	  its correspondent syntax

	- You can close the program by typing "Q"

	- When you run the program a "ReadFile.txt" file will appear. This is part of the program's functionality:
	  	>You can type commands in the file. Make sure you write one command per line.
	 	>Once you have all your commands saved you can make the program run them all.
	  	>Please note: in order for this to work write at least three commands in the file.

	- The program is CASE sensitive. Make sure you type the command characters in capital letters

	- When you run the "Execute" command (look for syntax by typing 'H' on the console) a 'LogFile.txt' file
	  will appear. You can look a history of all the commands performed within a session.

A java file is included if you wish to take a look at the source code. You are welcomed to do so.
